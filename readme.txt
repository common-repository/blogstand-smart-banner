== Description ==

Got your blog on Blogstand? Use this plugin to help your iPhone, iPod and iPad users find your blog and enjoy it on their device.

This plugin uses Smart Banners a new feature Apple has released in iOS 6.0. Smart Banners are a new way to let web visitors know about an optimized iOS app. Unlike traditional methods that are used, Smart Banners don't get in your readers way and always link directly to the app store that users trust. Their large and prominent close buttons mean that users can easily dismiss them if they're not interested in using the iOS app. 

Once you've signed up for Blogstand and published your blog through [http://app.blogstand.co/](http://app.blogstand.co), you'll get a Blog ID key. Simply paste this key into the settings page of this plugin (Settings -> Blogstand Banner) and you're good to go.

2. Activate the plugin after installing it, either by clicking on the "Activate" link or through the "Plugins" list.
3. Go to the plugin's settings (Settings => Blogstand Banner) and paste the Blog ID you obtained from [http://app.blogstand.co/](http://app.blogstand.co)
